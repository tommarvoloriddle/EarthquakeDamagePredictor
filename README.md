# EarthquakeDamagePredictor

Natural calamities have always challenged mankind. They have caused incalculable damage to structures and properties and caused the deaths of millions of people throughout the world. Earthquake is a good description of a natural phenomenon which suddenly strikes an area causing damage that varies according to the intensity of the quake and local geological conditions.

When a damaging earthquake hits a populated area, it is very important to grasp the overall distribution of building damage within several hours to a few days of the event, for the purpose of emergency response and restoration planning. An automated model that can predict the extent of damage that is done to a building post earthquake can readily reduce the manpower required in analysing such tasks and lead to quick decision making.

Determining the degree of damage that is done to buildings post an earthquake can help identify safe and unsafe buildings, thus avoiding death and injuries resulting from aftershocks.  Leveraging the power of machine learning is one viable option that can potentially prevent massive loss of lives while simultaneously making rescue efforts easy and efficient.

#Solution
Opensource dataset with a Million entries is considered which has all details of buildings including soil conditions and damage caused to it by recent earthquake.The damage in dataset is classified into 5 types from low to high
Machine Learning algorithms for supervised classification like Neural networks,KNN,NB classifier will be used and optimal algorithm will be chosen which has good accuracy and precision.
